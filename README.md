# TODO

Fill this out ;)

This is a React.js app designed to primarily be run and deployed locally for viewing privatley and publibly accessable tracker lists of generalized projects.

The Format for the data can be found in my other public repos, but the gist of it is:

# The Tracker JSON

This is just an array of URL's to the Item JSON Objects.  Make sure it is not nested.

# The Item JSON

This is the bread and butter of what this app ingests, the structure and all fields can be found in `/userItems/exampleUserItem.json`

TODO: Better explain here the options and what they do.
